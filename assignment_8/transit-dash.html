      <h2 class="mt-4 fs-3 fw-bold">Context/Problem</h2>
  
      <p>In my interaction design studio class, our team had to design a data dashboard for two given, transit related personas. The dashboard and personas had to be related to the new e-scooter rollout in
          Pittsburgh.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="mt-4 fs-3 fw-bold">Process</h2>
      <h3 class="mt-2 fs-5 fw-bold">Research</h3>
      <p>We were given the personas at the outset so the focus on this assignment was the design part. For research, we analyzed some basic transit data given in a spreadsheet to 
          explore potential avenues of data displays.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2 fs-5 fw-bold">Design</h3>
      <p>Our given personas had differing needs. One of them was Paula, a transit advocate that wanted to understand the e-scooter rollout impact on accessibility, both negative and positive.
      </p>
      <p>Another was Eliot, a policy analyst that wanted to ensure mobility for all Pittsburghers as well as making sure that the e-scooter rollout was equitable across different neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>As a team, we considered which data widgets would be most useful for both transit advocates. We also drew upon basic data dashboard design principles like having a clear typographic
          hierarchy, strong, logical labels and controlled use of color to draw focus to key areas.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="mt-4 fs-3 fw-bold">Solution</h2>
      <p>Our final dashboard solution included a map widget with accessibility overlays so that Paula could see if a scooter was blocking a pedestrian walkway. It also shows areas with low
          mobility options so that Eliot can advocate for more e-scooter distribution to those areas. Furthermore, we had a graph widget to display relevant trends from the map over a long period of time,
          and we had a mock Twitter API so that both Paula and Eliot could get real-time feedback on what people thought of the e-scooters.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, our team designed a robust data dashboard that met the needs of our assigned personas.</p>
