      <h2 class="mt-4 fs-3 fw-bold">Context/Problem</h2>
  
      <p>In my game design class, our team was given two challenges: First, form a viewpoint on climate change. Secondly, use a given theory of psychological change in order to compel
        people to change their behavior. So my team and I had to decide how we would approach this. How could we possibly combat the increasing doom and gloom in college students about 
      the future? The answer: We can't. But we did make this fun board game!</p>
      
      <h2 class="mt-4 fs-3 fw-bold">Process</h2>
      <h3 class="mt-2 fs-5 fw-bold">Research</h3>
      <p>We first needed to make an informed opinion on climate change. I have a background in research, so I skimmed a large quantity of research papers and articles about climate change.
        I arrived at the following climate optimistic opinion:</p>
        <p>In the face of climate change, people are feeling increasingly powerless to act, suffering from what some have called climate despair. However, there's
          good news. Renewable energy, particularly solar technology and batteries, is getting cheaper than coal and gas. In fact, it's getting so cheap that countries like India and China
          are voluntarily decarbonizing, not for the environment, but because it's more cost-effective.</p>
      <p>So that's the good news! But what was the best way to convey this to people? If we were trying to win hearts and minds, I would need to delve into the psychological literature.</p>
      <p>After I scoured the research literature, our group decided to focus on a psychological theory called norm activation,
        the concept that people can only feel moral obligation to act if they are aware of a problem AND if they feel like they can do something about it. 
        Specifically, we wanted them to feel like there were actions for them to take along with the actions of major governments to encourage renewable energy, 
        and to teach players that investment in renewables are compounding and positive-sum, with no long-term economic tradeoff.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-2 fs-5 fw-bold">Design</h3>
      <p>So how did we design and arrive at our game idea? The answer: We used a very rapid cycle of iterating and playtesting. As a team, we made rapid parallel prototypes, 
        compared them, combined them if we felt like it, and mutually agreed on the designs we liked best. Then, in class, we let other game design teams playtest our games and give 
        extensive feedback. Though our egos were sometimes challenged, invariably other teams would uncover problems in our game that we hadn't even considered. Finally after a few iteration
        cycles, we completed our game design and presented it.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="mt-4 fs-3 fw-bold">Solution</h2>
      <p>Our final game is called Energy Utopia. 4 players are first assigned a country to play as, and then given a random handful of cards with different investment opportunities on them (for instance,
        one card might allow you to invest in solar panels, another might allow you to invest in fracking). Depending on your country you start out with a different pool of money tokens, which
        you can spend on investments to gain back more money in later rounds. 
      </p>
      <p>The goal of the game is to lower the global temperature, represented by a cardboard thermometer we made. Each investment opportunity not only gives you money, but also lowers
        the temperature each round. You can spend your money on better investments which not only give your country more money but lower the temperature even faster in a increasing feedback
        loop.
      </p>
      <p>The point of the game is to show players that smart investments can have compounding environmentally beneficial returns and stem the tide of climate change. In playtesting, players found it
        a very optimistic game, not to mention an engaging one with lots of tactical decisions to make. That's it!
